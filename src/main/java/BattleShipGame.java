        The BattleshipGame class is the ”main” class–that is, it contains a main method. In this class you will set up
        the game; accept ”shots” from the user; display the results; print final scores; and ask the user if he/she
        wants to play again. All input/output is done here (although some of it is done by calling a print() method
        in the Ocean class.) All computation will be done in the Ocean class and the various Ship classes. Note that you
        want to accept 5 shots from the user. So you need to ensure that you have a well defined format for this.
        For example you can provide an instruction to the user as follows:
        The input format should look like this: 1, 1; 0, 3; 7, 3; 9, 11; 12, 17
